# LTZmu

## -- Work in progress --

The goal of this project is to create a low cost 10V voltage transfer standard for calibrating precision measurement devices (e.g. Fluke 732A). The project is based around the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltz1000.html">LTZ1000</a> by analog devices
